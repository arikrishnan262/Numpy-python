What is Numpy in Python?

NumPy is a powerful numerical computing library for Python that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these elements. It is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python and serves as a foundation for many other libraries in the data science and machine learning ecosystem.

Key features of NumPy include:

1. **Arrays:** NumPy provides an `array` object that is similar to Python lists but allows for more efficient manipulation of large datasets.

2. **Vectorized operations:** NumPy allows you to perform operations on entire arrays without the need for explicit loops, which makes it significantly faster and more efficient than traditional Python lists.

3. **Broadcasting:** NumPy supports broadcasting, which is a powerful mechanism that allows operations between arrays of different shapes and sizes.

4. **Mathematical functions:** NumPy includes a wide range of mathematical functions for operations such as linear algebra, statistical analysis, Fourier analysis, and more.

5. **Random number generation:** NumPy provides functions for generating random numbers and random sampling.

To use NumPy in your Python code, you typically start by importing the library:

```python
import numpy as np
